Welcome to the OBP API Explorer
===============================

# ABOUT

This application is used to explore the OBP API and interact with the data and services in the context of the logged in user.



# LICENSE

This project is licensed under the AGPL V3 (see NOTICE) and a commercial license from TESOBE.

# SETUP

The project is using sbt or Maven 3 as a build tool.
See build.scala or pom.xml respectively for the dependencies.

----

To compile and run jetty, cd into the root directory (where this file is) and run:

$ sbt
...
> compile
> ~;container:start; container:reload /

(Note that you first have to start sbt and then on its console start jetty with the container:start task, otherwise it will exit immediately. More here: https://github.com/siasia/xsbt-web-plugin/wiki)

In OS X, sbt can be installed with $ sudo port install sbt

----


Alternatively, maven can also be used:

`mvn jetty:run`

In case you want to specify and port as well use next command `mvn -Djetty.port=8082 jetty:run`


Note: You may need to add the pluginGroup to the $HOME/.m2/settings.xml

<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0

  ...
  <pluginGroups>
    <pluginGroup>org.mortbay.jetty</pluginGroup>
  </pluginGroups>

## To run with IntelliJ IDEA

* Make sure you have the IntelliJ Scala plugin installed.

* Create a new folder e.g. OpenBankProject and cd there

* git clone https://github.com/OpenBankProject/API-Explorer.git

* In IntelliJ IDEA do File -> New -> Project from existing sources, navigate to the folder and select pom.xml

* Alternatively you can do File -> New -> Project from VCS and checkout the project directly from github.

* Alternatively you can do File -> Open Folder and select the folder that contains pom.xml *This is the currently recommended method*

* When / if prompted for SDK, choose Java 1.8 (and Scala 2.11) otherwise keep the defaults. Use the Maven options. Do not change the project name etc.

* If you see a message about an unmanaged pom.xml, click the option to let Maven manage it.

* Navigate to test/scala/RunWebApp. You may see a Setup Scala SDK link. Click this and check Scala 2.11.8 or so.

* In src/main/resources/props create a \<yourloginname\>.props (or default.props) for development. For localhost set api_hostname=http://127.0.0.1:8080, base_url=http://localhost:8082, dev.port=8082 and oauth keys (i.e. obp_consumer_key and obp_consumer_secret) obtained from the api (at /consumer-registration) to run [OBP-API](https://github.com/OpenBankProject/OBP-API) in your local environment.

* Now **Rebuild** the project so everything is compiled. At this point you may need to select the SDK, see above.

* Once you have rebuilt the project without compile errors, you should be able to RunWebApp in test/scala

* Run RunWebApp by right clicking on it or selecting Run. The built in jetty server should start on localhost:8082

* Browse to localhost:8082 but don't try anything else there yet.

## Ubuntu

If you use Ubuntu (or a derivate) and encrypted home directories (e.g. you have ~/.Private), you might run into the following error when the project is built:

    uncaught exception during compilation: java.io.IOException
    [ERROR] File name too long
    [ERROR] two errors found
    [DEBUG] Compilation failed (CompilerInterface)

The current workaround is to move the project directory onto a different partition, e.g. under /opt/ .

# PROPS FILE

There is a props file template provided at src/main/resources/props/sample.props.template. It needs to be renamed and modified or just copy and paste a new in order for the application to work.

1. Renaming:

The sample.props.template file must be renamed for Lift to find it (https://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/liftweb/Properties). Renaming it to default.props
should be the easiest way to get started.


*base_url*

The base_url is used to calculate the callback url to give to the Open Bank Project API server. This should just be the
base url used to access the API Explorer. So if you're running a copy of the API Explorer at
api-explorer.example.com over https, on the standard port, it would be "https://api-explorer.example.com".
An example value for local development could be: http://127.0.0.1:8082 (8082 is the default Lift development port)

*api_hostname*

The api_hostname should be the base url of the Open Bank Project API. For example, https://api.openbankproject.com/api amd for local development api_hostname should be http://127.0.0.1:8080 in props file. 

*obp_consumer_key*
*obp_secret_key*

The keys are obtained by registering as a developer on the Open Bank Project API server located at "api_hostname".


All in all, a props file could look something like:

api_hostname=https://api.openbankproject.com/api 

### OR 
The base url of the api to use for local: 
api_hostname=http://127.0.0.1:8080

obp_consumer_key=uodsifnodsfifdsliufdsliufdsfdsfsdfsx \
obp_secret_key=iuesbfiyvglxzgifg7eisgei7fglesfi \
base_url=http://localhost:8082
